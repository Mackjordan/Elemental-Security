### Shared responsibility
No individual, business, or government entity is solely responsible for cyber security. Everyone has a role to play.
* It is important to keep in mind that most individuals either aren’t aware of potential dangers and/or security and privacy best practices.
* On-going education is essential.
* Educational programs should stress that individual actions matter and that adherence to best practices, policies, and regulations are critical (and expected).
* Educational programs should be tailored to roles and audience.

### The NIST SETA Model

* SETA - Security Education, Training, and Awareness

| Security | Education | Training | Awareness |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Attribute | Why | How | What |
| Level | Insight | Knowledge | Information |
| Objective | Understanding | Skill | Awareness |
| Teaching Method | Discussion, seminar, reading | Lecture, case study, hands-on | Interactive, video, posters, games |
| Test Measure | Essay | Problem solving | True or false, multiple choice |
| Impact Timeframe | Long-term | Intermediate | Short-term. |


### Role-based Awareness Training

| Role | Focus                                                        |    SETA   |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Executive User | Strategy, policy, and organizational impact (risk) | Education |
| System Owner | Business process and impact                          | Education |
| Data Owner | Data protection and privacy                            | Education |
| System Admin | Implementing, managing and monitoring controls       | Training  |
| Privileged User | ”Privileged” functions                            | Training  |
| User | Responsible use (AUP) and best practices                     | Awareness |


### Employee awareness programs
Employee awareness programs should include:
* Onboarding (initial and at 3 months) which includes polices, best practices, social engineering, duress, and reporting suspicious activity.
* Annual compliance and ”hot topic” training (instructor led, recorded, online).
* Videos, demonstrations, examples, and interactive quizzes are very effective.
* On-going awareness program which includes posters, games, contests, prizes, and surveys.

### Executive Continuing Education
General constraints.
* Time is limited.
* Technical expertise may be minimal.
* Patience for not understanding is limited.

Objective is insight and understanding for the long-term.
* Know your audience presentation preferences.
* Provide a discussion framework and pre-reading materials.
* Be specific to institutional goals (including regulatory requirements).
* Use business language.
* Cover a limited number of topics — stay focused.
