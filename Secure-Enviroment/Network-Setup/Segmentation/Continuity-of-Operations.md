# Continuity of Operations  

### COOP
The objective of a Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) is to prepare for continued operation of essential functions and services during disruption of normal operating conditions. To support this objective:
* Threat scenarios are evaluated and risk rated.
* Essential services and processes are prioritized (BIA).
* Response, recovery (including fail—over) and contingency plans are developed.
* Strategies, plans, and procedures are tested.

 In every circumstance, human life and safety take precedence over facilities, technology, and all other assets.

### COOP Components
Key components of a COOP include:
* Assignment of roles and responsibilities including succession
* ”Big picture” strategy
* Plan description (and synergies with other plans).
* Preparation
* Declaration (generally based on anticipated duration).
* Activation, execution, and return to normalization.
* External relationships and resources including alternate locations and processing sites.

### COOP Exercise
The objective of COOP exercises should be to evaluate plans, procedures and performance; not institutional knowledge.
* The final step of a COOP exercise is an After-action Report which documents the success/failure of the exercise and details followup tasks and if required, modifications.

### External Relationships
External relationships may include (but are not limited to) alternate locations and processing sites, moving assistance, procurement, personnel augmentation, outsourcing, and public relations.
* Contracts should clearly state the type of service, expenses, activation and notification requirements, response protocols, length of service, and compliance requirements.

### Alternate Location & Processing Sites
|                 |                                                       |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Cold Site | A cold site has basic HVAC infrastructure; no server-related or communications equipment. |
| Mobile site | A mobile site is a transportable modular unit. The delivery site must provide access roads, water, waste disposal, power, and connectivity. |
| Warm Site | A warm site has HVAC, servers, and communications infrastructure and equipment. Systems might need to be configured. Data needs to be restored. |
| Hot Site | A hot site has HVAC, servers, and communications infrastructure and equipment. Systems are preconfigured. Data is generally near-time. |
| Mirrored Site | A mirrored site is fully redundant with real-time replication from production site. Mirrored Site can assume processing With Virtually no interruption. |
| Reciprocal Site | A reciprocal site is based on an agreement to have access to/use of another organization facilities. |

### Alternate Business Process Strategies
Alternate business process strategies assume that normal dependencies (technology, facilities, personnel) may not be available. Options include, but are not limited to:
* manual processes
* using cross—trained personnel
* notification of delay
* outsourcing

### COOP Exercise (Passive)
| Exercise    | Description        | Objective     |
|-------------|--------------------|---------------|
| Read-through [Desk check] | Personnel or departments review their plans and procedures for accuracy and completeness | Accuracy Familiarity |
| Walk-through [Tabletop] | Scenario-based group workshop focuses on the application of plans and procedures as well as participant readiness. Promotes coordination and communication | Coordination Communication |

### COOP Exercise (Active)
| Exercise    | Description        | Objective     |
|-------------|--------------------|---------------|
| Preparedness, [Parallel], [Functional], [Simulation] | Localized scenario that simulates an actual event and limits material and equipment to what would be possible if the situation were an actual event. Activation of backup systems and/or recovery of primary systems. Generally parallel tests are components-, device-, or system-level. Primary systems may remain active. | Evidence of localized readiness. |
| Interruption [Full-scale] | Test all components of the designated plan simultaneously. Primary environment is not operational. | Evidence of enterprise readiness. |
