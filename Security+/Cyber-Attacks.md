# Cyber Attacks.

___
## Anticipating Cyber Attacks
___
### Cyber Attacks can result in:
* Unauthorized access to or theft of data, which is a violation of confidentiality.
* Modification of data, which is a violation of integrity.
* Inaccessibility of data or a disruption of service, which is a violation of availability.

___
## Common terms
___

### Confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) are the cornerstones of information security.

#### Confidentiality
Confidentiality is the principle that only authorized people, processes, or systems have access to information and that information must be protected from unauthorized disclosure.

#### Integrity
Integrity is the principle that information or systems should be protected from unintentional, unauthorized or accidental charges. (Could also be known as data or system integrity.)

#### Availability
Availability is the principle that information and systems are operating and accessible when needed.

Cyber incident resilience:
Is the ability to successfully withstand an attack.


### Defense-in-depth:
Is a design and implementation of multiple overlapping layers of controls. A control (Sometimes called the countermeasure of safeguard ) is a tactic, mechanism, or strategy that either:
* Reduces or eliminate a vulnerability.
* Reduces or eliminate the likelihood that a threat agent will be able to exploit a vulnerability.
* Reduces or eliminate the impact of an exploit.
