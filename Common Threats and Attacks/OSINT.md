# Open Source Threat Intelligence (OSINT):

OSINT is a term used to refer to the data collected from publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context. In the intelligence community, the term “open” refers to overt, publicly available sources ( As opposed to covert or clandestine sources.)

### Simplified Threat Modeling.


| Number | Question | Factor |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Why would an adversary target my organization? | Motivation |
| 2 | How hard would it be for an adversary to achieve their objectives? | Workfactor |
| 3 | Are we aware of the latest threats, tools and techniques? | Threat Intelligence |
| 4 | Would we know if we were being attacked? | Threat |
| 5 | Are we prepared to respond to an attack? | Resliency |

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Motivation | is the driving force behind any attack. Organizations should identify what information, services, or power an organization possesses that is of value to an adversary. |
| Workfactor | is the time, effort, and talent needed for an attacker to successfully achieve their objective. The intensity of the workfactor should match the criticality and/or sensitivity of the asset you are protecting. |
| Threat intelligence | Evidence-based knowledge about an emerging threat that can be used to inform control decisions. An indicator of Compromise (IOC) is an artifact that indicates the possibility of an attack or compromise of some kind. The most common indicators are file hashes ( Signatures ), and reputations data on domains and IP addresses that have been associated with an attack. |


### OSINT FRAMEWORK

An Open Source Threat Intelligence Framework is a platform for collecting, storing, distributing and sharing threat indicators and malware analysis.
   Examples:
* Osintframework.com
* Openioc.org
* Misp-project.org

### Useful Threat Intelligence
Useful Threat Intelligence is aggregate, analyzed, accurate and actionable.
* Aggregated from reliable sources and cross correlated for accuracy.
* Analyzed by trained specialist.
* Assessed for relevency,
* Actionable. Often includes context, mechanisms, indicator of compromise, implications and response/remediation advice.
Value of Threat intelligence.

The true value of threat intelligence is in it’s application.
* Changing the security model from reactive to proactive - if you understand your adversaries, you can develop tactics to combat current attacks and plan better for future threats.
* Driving better, more informed responses to security incidents.
