# Social Engineering
Social engineering describes a class of techniques used to manipulate people by deception, into divulging information or performing an action.
The information or action may in itself be useful or be a stepping stone.

Using perception, persuasion, and influence, Social Engineers (Criminals) take advantage of basic human instincts and responses including:
* The instinct to respond to authority.
* The tendency to trust people.
* The desire to be responsive.
* The fear of getting in trouble.
* The threat of harm.
* The promise of a reward.

###### Common Social Engineering Platforms:
