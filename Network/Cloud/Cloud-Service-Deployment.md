# Cloud Computing
"Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction” NISTspsoo-145
* Service models (SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS)
* Deployment models (private cloud, community cloud, and public cloud)

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
##### Computing Resources + Operating System + application.
The customer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities. The customer uses the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The customer has control over limited user-specific application configuration.   

* Availability
* Maintenance
* Vulnerability management
* Confidentiality
* Privacy
* Data Ownership
* Multitenancy
* Testing  

### Platform as a Service
##### Computing Resources + Operating System + (Option Database)
The customer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure, operating system, Programming languages, tools, and platform. The customer deploys onto the cloud infrastructure created or acquired applications. The customer has control over deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for application-hosting environment.

* Availability
* Maintenance
* Vulnerability management
* Confidentiality
* Privacy
* Data Ownership

### Infrastructure as a Service
##### Bare metal computing Resources
The customer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure. The customer can provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources. The customer has control over the operating system, storage, and deployed applications and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g. host firewalls.)

* Availability
* Maintenance
* Vulnerability management

| Model | Description | Considerations |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Public Cloud | Provisioned for public use | Location, Multitenancy |
| Community Cloud | Provisioned for the exclusive use by a well—defined group. | Multitenancy |
| Private Cloud | Provisioned for the exclusive use of a organization. | Scalability |
| Hybrid Cloud | The public and private cloud infrastructures, which operate independently of each other, communicate over an encrypted connection, using technology that allows for the portability of data and applications. | Security of the connection. |

### Cloud Access Security Brokers
Cloud access security brokers (CASBs) are security policy points (software or appliance) placed between ”the cloud" and enterprise users.
* Security policies are interjected as cloud-based resources are accessed. For example, authentication, encryption, visibility and DLP.
* CASBs proxy traffic and use auto discovery to identify cloud applications.
* Provides control over ”shadow IT” applications.

### Security as a Service (SecaaS)
SecaaS is the delivery of managed security services for public, private, and hybrid cloud environments.
* SecaaS relives the burden of relying on the SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS vendor for security protection and enforcement.
* Services include encryption, activity monitoring, DLP, malware detection, filtering, firewall, policy enforcement, email security, intrusion detection, authentication, and more.
* The cloud security market is expected to reach $8.71 billion by 2019.

### On Premise vs. Cloud Decisioning
##### Legal regulatory contractual
Need to evaluate legal, regulatory, or contractual restrictions or obligations. For example:
* Country where data is stored, processed, or transmitted
* Required controls

##### Infrastructure
Need to evaluate the required investment to build, maintain, and support the
infrastructure.

##### Availability
Need to evaluate capability of resources and ability to provision additional
resources.

##### DR & BC
Need to evaluate synergy with disaster recovery and business continuity strategies and requirements.

##### Security
Need to evaluate security and privacy requirements.
