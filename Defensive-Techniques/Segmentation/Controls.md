# Control [Refresher]
A control (sometimes called the countermeasure or safeguard) is a tactic, mechanism, or strategy that either:
* Reduces or eliminates a vulnerability. Weakness
* Reduces or eliminates the likelihood that a threat agent will be able to exploit a vulnerability.
* Reduces or eliminates the impact of an exploit.

### Functionally & Effectiveness
Functionality is what a control does. Effectiveness is how well a control works.
* Effectiveness is a reflection of the controlâ€™s consistent, complete, reliable, and timely operation.

### Control Classification
| Deterrent | Preventive | Detective | Corrective |
|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|
| Deterrent controls discourage a threat agent from acting. | Preventive controls stop a threat agent from being successful. | Detective controls identify and report a threat agent, action, or incident. | Corrective controls minimize the impact of a threat agent, or incident. |

##### Compensating
Compensating controls are alternate controls designed to accomplish the
Compensating intent of the original controls as closely as possible, when the originally
designed controls cannot be used due to limitations of the environment or
financial constraints.
###### Note:
* A control can (and often does) have multiple classifications depending upon context


### Control Implementations
|       | Administrative       | Physical     | Technical (Logical) |
|-------|----------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Description | Controls relating to the oversight, laws, rules, and regulations. | Controls that can have a material structure (seen, heard, touched). | Controls provided through the use of technology and/or a digital device. |
| Example | Policies, procedures, training, audits, compliance reporting. | Gate, alarm, guard, barricade, door, lock, CCTV, ID card. | Encryption, ACLs, firewall rules, anti-virus software, biometric authentication. |

### Control Cross-Over Examples
| Control | Deterrent | Preventive | Detective | Corrective |
|---------|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|
| Firewall Technical Control | "Hardened" appearance discouraged opportunistic attacks | Rule-set blocks certain ingress and engress traffic. | Activity is logged and alerts can be configured. | N/A |    
| Security Awareness Training Administrative Controls | Advises participants of penalties and consequences. | Teaches participants what NOT to do. | Trains participants on what to be "on the lookout for" suspicious activity and how to report it. | Instructs participants on how to respond to threat. |
| Door Alarm Physical Control | Discourages use of a alarmed door. | N/A | Reacts to the door being opens or threshold crossing. | Sounds an alarm that might scare off the intruder. |
