# Auditing Concepts
| Term | Determination |
|------|---------------|
| Account Auditing | Is this a valid account? |
| Membership Auditing | Are membership assignments correct? |
| Permissions Auditing | Are the explicit/inherited permissions appropriate? |
| Usage Auditing | Is user activity and resource utilization within normal boundaries?
| Authorization Creep | Authorization creep is the accumulation of access rights, permissions, and privileges over time. Promotions, lateral moves, cross-training, and temporary coverage may contribute to authorization creep. |
| Recertification | Management validates that rights and permission assignment are correct and that they adhere to internal policies and compliance requirements. Also referred to as access attestation or entitlements review. |
