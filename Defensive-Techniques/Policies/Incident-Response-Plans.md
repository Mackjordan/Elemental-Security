# Incident Response Plan and Playbook
An incident response plan includes roles and responsibilities, strategies and procedures for preparing for, responding to, and managing incidents.

* A incident playbook is a set of instructions for responding to a specific type of event, attack or scenario. Generally playbooks are developed for high risk events (measured in terms of likelihood and impact). For example, malware, DDOS attacks, ransomware extortion and payment card compromise.

### Security Incident
An security incident is an event or action that endangers the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or information systems.
* A data breach is when data is ex-filtrated or extracted or there is a loss of control. A data breach may trigger reporting and notification requirements.

### IRP Components
| Component | Description  |
|-----------|--------------|
| Incident types and Categorization | Based on severity and used to determine response times, resource assignments, and preparation requirements. |
| Roles and responsibilities | Assignments including first responders, incident handlers, and designated spokespersons. |
| Reporting requirements | How incidents are internally reported, documented, and reviewed as well as when notification requirements are triggered. |
| Escalation requirements | Definitions for escalation thresholds. |
| Incident Response Team | Membership, preparation, skill requirements, external resources.|
| Exercise requirements | Training and exercise requirements and reporting. |

### IRT Membership and Resources
Membership of the incident response team (IRT) is generally composed of internal personnel and adjunct (as needed) external resources.
* Internal personnel should represent a cross-section of the organization including operations, information security, information technology, risk management, marketing, legal and compliance, and executive management.
* External resources include forensic experts, legal counsel,
insurance representatives, public relations, and law enforcement.

### Incident Response Training
Incident response training should be included in organization-wide SETA programs.
* All personnel should be aware of potential incident scenarios and reporting procedures.
* First responders and CIRT team members/should receive training related to their assigned tasks.
* Executives should be educated on incident-relate organizational risks.  

### Incident Response Testing
Incident response exercises should be conducted on a periodic basis to assure readiness.
* Exercises include tabletop and simulations.
* Participants should include the CIRT team, external resources, and as applicable, executive management.
