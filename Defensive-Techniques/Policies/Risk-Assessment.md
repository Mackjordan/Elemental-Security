# Risk Assessment
A risk assessment is used to identify the level of risk.

* Determining the scope and scheduling of risk assessments is a risk management function. However, it is common for this process to be managed by the audit department.
* Controls are generally not validated during the assessment process. Control validation is an audit function.

### Risk Assessment Workflow

1. Determine the risk assessment approach (Quantitative, Qualitative, Hybrid)
2. Identify the Inherent risk based on relevant threats and related vulnerabilities.
3. Assess the impact if the threat source was successful.
4. Identify applicable controls and their effectiveness.
5. Assess the likelihood of occurrence, taking into consideration the control environment.
6. Determine the level of residual risk.

### Risk Assessment Approaches

##### Qualitative
* Qualitative risk assessments use descriptive terminology such as high, medium, and low or normal, elevated, and severe.

##### Quantitative
* Quantitative risk assessments assign numeric and monetary values to all elements of the assessment.  
###### Key elements of both are likelihood of occurrence and impact.

### Quantitative Risk Assessment Elements
Quantitative risk assessment elements include:

* Asset value (AV) expressed $
* Exposure factor (EF) expressed as a %
* Single loss expectancy (SLE) expressed in $
* Annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) expressed as a #
* Annualized loss expectancy (ALE) expressed in $

### Quantitative Formulas
##### SLE ($) = AV (S) x EF (%)
* Single Loss Expectancy = Asset Value x Exposure Factor
###### Revenue from one hour of e-commerce is $20,000 (AV) A DDoS attack could disrupt 85% (EF) of online activity. $20,000 (AV) * .85 (EF) = $17,000 (SLE) The cost of an hour of DDos disruption is $17,000


##### ALE ($) = SLE ($) x ARO (#)
* Annualized Loss Expectancy = Single Loss Expectancy x Annualized Rate of Occurrence.
###### Single Loss Expectancy (for an hour of DDoS disruption) is $17,000 (SLE) Based on the current threat and controls environment it is expected that there will be 5 hour (ARO) of DDoS Disruption per year. $17,000 (SLE) * 5 (ARO) - $85,000 (ALE)

### Quantitative Risk Assessment Process

1. Determine Asset Value (AV).
2. Determine Exposure Factor (EF)
3. Calculate Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
4. Determine Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
5. Calculate Annualized Loss expectancy (ALE)
