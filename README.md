# Elemental-Security
Security Fundamentals that should be considered across all organizations.

This repository will be an overview fundamental security practices for corporations and individuals. This will be an ongoing project, throughout my career in information security and beyond. I would like to use this as a reference and has guide. I’ll be storing scripts, articles, code samples and links in this project.

If you’re security minded and would like to contribute, I would love to learn from you.
