# Data loss prevention (DLP)
DLP tools are designed to detect and prevent data ex-filtration (unauthorized release or removal of
data).
* DLP technologies locate and catalog sensitive data (based on
a predetermined set of rules or criteria).
* DLP tools monitor target data while in use, in motion, and at
rest.

### DLP Location
| Location | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Network-based (On premise) | Network-based (hardware or virtual appliance) deals with data in motion and is usually located on the network perimeter. |
| Storage-based | Storage-based (software) operates on long-term storage (archive) | End-point based | End-point based (software) operates on a local device and focuses on data-in-use.
| Cloud-based | Cloud-based operates In “the cloud” data in use, motion, and at rest |

### DLP End-point Port Blocking
DLP solutions can be used to identify and control end-point ports as well as block access to removable media.
* Identify removable devices / media connected to your network by type (e.g., USB thumb drive, CD burner, smart phone), manufacturer, model number, and MAC address.
* Control and manage removable devices through endpoint ports, including USB, FireWire, Wi-Fi, Modem / Network NIC, and Bluetooth.
* Require encryption, limit file types, limit file size.
* Provide detailed forensics on device usage and data transfer by person, time, file type, and amount.
