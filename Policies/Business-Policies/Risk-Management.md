# RISK
Risk is the measurement of likeihood and impact of a threat event occurring.
* Risk management is the identification, assessment, prioritization, treatment, and monitoring of risks.
* Risk appetite is the level of risk that an organization is comfortable with.

### Threat Assessment
A information security threat is a potential danger to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. (C.I.A)
* A threat assessment is used to identify, categorize, an prioritize potential threats.


### Threat Classifications

##### Environmental Classifications
* Natural events (e.g. earthquakes, storms, floods)
* Physical events (e.g. fire, pollution)
* Loss of services (e.g. electrical power, HVAC)
* Technical failures (equipment, software, communications)

##### Manmade Classifications
* Internal malicious or accidental/inadvertent actions or behaviors (employees, contractors, vendors, business partners, customers, regulators).
* External malicious actions or behaviors (cybercriminals, hacktivists, nation-states, terrorists)

4. Risk Monitoring
5. Repeat the Process

### Risk Assessment
A risk assessment is used to identify the level of risk.
* Risk is assessed by evaluating the combination of the likeihood of the occurrence, and the adverse impact if the circumstance or event occurs.
* The target of a risk assessment can be internal systems/process or external supply chain relationships (e.g. vendors, business partners).

### Risk Treatment
Risk treatment is how an organization responds to identified risks—generally defined as actions taken to either mitigate the impact of the undesirable or unfavorable outcome and/or enhance the likelihood of a positive outcome.
* Inherent risk is the level of risk before treatment.
* Residual risk is the level of risk after treatment.

### Risk Treatment Options 
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Ignore | Act as if the risk doesn’t exist. |
| Avoidance | Eliminate the cause or terminate the associated activity
| Mitigation | Reduce the impact or likelihood by implementing controls or safeguards.|
| Deterrence | Discourage the threat action or adversary from taking action. |
| Share | Spread the risk among multiple parties. |
| Transference | Assign the risk to another party via insurance or contractual agreement (subject to legal and regulatory constraints) |
| Acceptance | Acknowledge the risk and monitor it. |

### Risk Monitoring
The objective of risk monitoring is to track known risks, evaluate treatment effectiveness, identify new risks, and schedule on—going assessments.
* A risk register is a tool used to document organizational risks and ancillary details such as owner, treatment measures, and monitoring tasks.

### Security Testing
Security testing (e.g. penetration testing and vulnerability assessments) are used to identify weaknesses as well as substainated strengths and are a critical component of the risk monitoring process.
* Testing should be authorized by management.
* Detailed test results should be considered confidential.
