### Employee Lifecycle

1. Hiring process
2. Onboarding
3. Employment
4. Offboarding

### Onboarding
Onboarding is the process of integrating a new employee with a company and culture as well as getting the tools and information they need to be successful.
* User orientation is the initial task on completing paperwork (including Confidentiality and Acceptable Use Policy agreements), introductions, and initial training.
* User provisioning is the process of creating user accounts and credentials, assigning access rights and permissions, and providing assets.
* Each department should have documented procedures related to user onboarding.

### Background Check
A background check is an investigative report. It may include criminal, financial, credit and/or education history, workers compensation claims, and public records.
* The depth and breath of a background check should specifically be related to job roles and responsibilities and level of access.
* The applicant has a right to privacy. Consent should always be requested.
* Per U.S. Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), if a consumer report is a factor in a negative hiring decision (adverse action), the applicant is entitled to know the source of information used against them.

### User Management
Shared responsibility for educating employees, managing user access, implementing controls, and monitoring activity.
* Departments involved generally include Human Resources (HR), Information Technology (IT), Information Security, and Risk Management.
* Each department should have documented polices and procedures related to user management.

### User Security Controls 
| Control      |  Description                                          |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Job Rotation | Rotating assignments (fraud deterrent and detection). |
| Mandatory Vacation | Requiring employees to take a set amount of vacation time (fraud deterrent and detection). |
| Separation of Duties | Breaking a task into segments so that no one subject is in complete control (fraud prevention/deterrent— would require collusion). |
| Dual Control | Requiring more than one subject or key to complete a specific task
(fraud prevention/deterrent— would require collusion). |
| Clean Desk | Requirement to never leave confidential data (paper, monitor, whiteboard) unattended or within view of unauthorized personnel. |


### Termination
Termination is the process of ending someone’s employment. How termination is handled depends upon the specific circumstances (friendly/unfriendly) and transition arrangements that have been made with the employee.
* Tasks include removing the employee from the payroll and benefits system, recovering physical assets (e.g. smartphone), access control assets (e.g. token, smartcard, keys), deleting or disabling local and remote access, deleting or disabling user accounts and access permission, archiving documents and email, and reassigning file folder permissions.
* Termination related tasks should be documented (checklist/procedure).

### Offboarding
Offboarding is the process for transitioning employee out of an organization.

Tasks include:
* Documenting separation details.
* Tasks and responsibilities prior to departure.
* Knowledge transfer.
* Exit interview.
