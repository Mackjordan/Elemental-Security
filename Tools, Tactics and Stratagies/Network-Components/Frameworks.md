# Information Security Frameworks
A framework is a logical structure.
* An intent of an information security framework is to document
and organize processes related to the implementation,
management, and maintenance of information security
controls.

A framework can be the basis of a common assessment and
certification.
* Used by internal stakeholders to evaluate controls.
* External auditors to evaluate and assess to controls in place.
* Third parties to evaluate the risk of partnering with/doing
business with an organization.


### Framework Focus
##### Industry Standard
Based on established and generally accepted norms
##### Regulatory
Reflective of regulatory expectations and examination requirements
##### National
Designed for use in a specific country or consortium (e.g. EU). Objective is generally economic or military security.
##### International
Promoted globally, Developed by representatives from participating areas
##### Industry Specific
Specific to a industry, Developed, promoted, and enforced by industry members.

### Information Security Benchmark
An information security benchmark is intended to help an organization identify their cybersecurity capabilities and initiatives and compare those efforts to peers or competitors of the same sector or size.
* This snapshot is prepared either internally by the organization or by a third party.

### Configuration Guidance
Platform-specific and vendor-specific configuration guidance is available from a variety of sources including government agencies, industry groups, non-profit consortiums, and vendors.
* Guidance can be in the form of a narrative, checklist,
spreadsheet, or installation files.
* No need to reinvent the wheel!
* Configuration changes should be subject to configuration
management and change control processes.

### Defense-in-depth
Every standard will allude to the importance of defense-in-depth. In addition to multiple layers of controls, the following should not be overlooked.
* Vendor diversity
* Control diversity (technical, physical, administrative)
* User training
