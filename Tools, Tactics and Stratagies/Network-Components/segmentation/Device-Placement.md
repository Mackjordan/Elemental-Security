# Device Placement
The effectiveness of a security device is directly tied to placement. The majority of devices are appliances, sensors, or collectors.
* An appliance is a self-contained (hardware and software/firmware) network resource.
* A sensor is a device that collects information about the network or host. A sensor can report and/or produce events and/or control.
* A collector is a device that performs targeted collection from distributed data which feeds into an aggregation or correlation engine.


##### IDS/ IPS (Network)
* Monitors and reports on intrusions (IDS) and can take action (IPS)

##### Firewalls
* Controls ingress and egress traffic

##### Filters
* Filters access (e.g. SPAM, Content, DLP, URL)

##### Proxy
* Acts on behalf of a client (e.g. forward, transparent)

##### VPN concentrator
* End point for a network/site VPN connection

##### SSL accelerators
* Offloads processor intensive SSL/TLS encryption and decryption

##### Load balancers
* Distribution of workload across multiple resources (server fa rm)

##### Aggregation switch
* Layer 2 switch that provides connectivity for other switches.

##### DDoS Mitigation
* Inline device to detect and repeal DDoS attacks

##### Network Tap (Terminal Access Point)
* Capture network traffic between two devices (port A and port B) and copies the traffic to its monitor port.

##### Port Mirror / SPAN
* Capture network traffic from one or several ports of a switch and forwards a copy to the analysis device

##### Correlation Engine 
* Analyzes relationships between events (component of a SIEM)
