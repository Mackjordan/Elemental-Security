# Environmental Impact
Computers, electronic equipment, and transmission media are sensitive to environmental factors such as heat, humidity, air flow, and power quality.
* Environmental imbalance can impact stability, availability, and integrity.
* HVAC systems should be continually monitored and set to alarm for deviations.
* HVAC system access to controls should be restricted and changes logged.

### Temperature
Data Centers (inclusive of server rooms and networking closets) need to be kept cool.
* Acceptable temperature for an area containing computing devices is between 70—74 degrees.
* Damaging temperatures: Computers -175F, Magnetic Storage -100F, Paper products -350F.

### Hot Aisle / cold Aisle Circulation

A server farm floor plan that provides a path for the efficient flow of air conditioning. Rows of equipment racks are positioned face to face and back to back to direct the air flow. The time to create a hot aisle/cold aisle layout is when the datacenter is being designed. Air conditioning is blown into the cold aisles, and the heated air rises to the return vent.

### Humidity and ESD
High humidity can cause corrosion and low humidity can cause excessive static electricity.
* Relative humidity between 45—60% is acceptable for areas that are processing data.
* Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is the release of static electricity when two objects touch. ESD can damage or destroy electronic components.
* ESD can be minimized by the use of antistatic grounding workbenches, mats, bags and wristbands.
* Electrical storms can increase the ESD risk.

### EMI and RFI
Equipment and copper cable are sensitive to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI).
* EMI is due to electromagnetic conduction or radiation. Almost any type of electrical device can cause EMI.
* RFI is due to AM/FM and cellular tower transmissions.
* Equipment should have limited exposure to magnets, fluorescents lights, electric motors, space heaters, and wireless access points.
* Copper cable should be shielded.

### Data Emanation
Data emanation (or signal emanation) is the electromagnetic (EM) field generated by a coax or copper cable or network devices, which can be manipulated to eavesdrop on conversations or to steal data.
* A Faraday cage or shield is an enclosure used to block electromagnetic (EM) fields (incoming and outgoing)
* Faraday bags are often used in digital forensics to prevent remote wiping and alteration of evidence.

### Wiretapping
Tapping into a transmission infrastructure can be accomplished in multiple ways including connecting to a punch down block, plugging into a open port, splitting the wires of a twisted pair connection, or using a spectral analyzer to access data emanation.
* A Protected Distribution System (PDS) is a combination of controls designed to deter and detect access to communication lines.
* A PDS (approved circuits) is required by the US Government to transmit unencrypted classified information.

### Airgap
Airgap refers to computers or networks that are physically isolated from the Internet or to any other computers that are connected to the Internet.
* Data can only pass to it via a USB flash drive, other removable media, or a firewire connecting two computers directly.
* Air gaps generally are implemented where the system or network requires extra security, such as classified military networks or industrial control systems that operate critical infrastructure.

### Power
Electrical power supplied to electronic devices must have consistent voltage and a minimum of interference.
* Devices need to be protected against surges, spikes, sags, brownouts and blackouts.

### Power Protection
| Category | Description | Mitigating Control |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|
| Blackout | Prolonged period without power | Battery backup (UPS), Alternate power, Supplier diversity|
| Brownout | Prolonged period of low voltage | Voltage regulator, Surge protectors, Battery backups (UPS), Power line conditioners
| Sag | Moment of low voltage | Voltage regulator, Surge protectors, Battery backups (UPS), Power line conditioners
| Surge | Prolonged period of high voltage | Voltage regulator, Surge protectors, Battery backups (UPS), Power line conditioners
| Spike | Moment of high voltage | Voltage regulator, Surge protectors, Battery backups (UPS), Power line conditioners
| Power Supply Failure | Failure of internal power supply or Redundant fan| Redundant Power Supply |

### Fire
Fire protection is comprised of three elements:
* Fire prevention is the first line of defense.
* Fire detection is realizing there is a fire while it is still small and controllable.
* Fire suppression and containment is actually dealing with the fire.

### Fire Class
| Class | Type of Fire | Type of Extinguisher |
|-------|--------------|----------------------|
| A |  Ordinary combustibles: Water, wood, paper, rubber, fabrics and many plastics | Water, Dry Powder, Halon |
| B | Flammable Liquids and Gases: gasoline, oils, paint. lacquer, and tar | Carbon Dioxide, Dry powder, Halon |
| C | Fires Involving Electrical Equipment | Carbon Dioxide, Dry Powder, Halon |
| D | Combustible Metals or Combustible Metal Alloys | Special Agents |
| K | Fires in Cooking Appliances that involve Combustible Cooking Media: Vegetable or Animal Oils and Fats. |

### Fire Suppression
##### Water-based 
* Sprinkler system effective on Class A (ordinary combustible) fires

##### Dry-Pipe
* Sprinkler system effective on Class A (ordinary combustible) fires. Pipes do not have water in them until system is activated Automatic shut-off

##### Halon
* Pressurized Halon gas that removes oxygen from the air with no residue Banned by the Montreal Protocol of 1987

##### FM-200  
Colorless, orderless gaseous halocarbon with no residue. Safe for human beings

##### Argonite
* Mixture of argon and nitrogen gas. Although non—toxic, it can be dangerous to humans.

##### C02
* Pressurized gas — manual discharge required. Extremely dangerous to humans.
