# Mobile Connection Methods

Mobile Device
A mobile device is a generic term for any communication device
that is portable.
* A laptop is an all-in-one personal computer that can easily be
moved and used in a variety of locations. Laptops use the same
operating systems as desktops.
* A tablet is a touchscreen device that has thin flat form factor.
Tablets require specialized operating systems.
* A smartphone is pocket-sized touchscreen device that
incorporates traditional cell phone features. Smartphones
require specialized operating systems

### Connection Methods
| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Cellular | Radio frequency distributed network |
| WiFi | Radio frequency contained network |
| SATCOM | Satellite communications network |
| Bluetooth | Shortwave network |
| NFC | Nearfield communications network |
| ANT | ”Wearables” sensor network |
| IR | Optical short-wave network |
| USB | Wireless USB bus |

### Cellular
A cellular network is a radio frequency distributed network that
divides geographic areas into cells. Cells are serviced by a fixed
location transceiver (base station).
* Cellular networks are used to transmit voice and data.
* Range is variable dependent upon the cell frequency.
* Cellular is a mature technology. Security controls have improved
with each generation; however, cellular networks are still
vulnerable to denial of service attacks.

### Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi is a technology for wireless local area networking with devices
based on IEEE 802.11 standards
* Devices that can use Wi-Fi technology include personal computers,
video game consoles, smartphones, digital cameras, tablet
computers, smart TVs, digital audio players and modern printers.
* Wi-Fi compatible devices can connect to the Internet via a WLAN and
a wireless access point based on the IEEE 802.11 standards.
* Range depends on the frequency band, radio power output, antenna
gain, and antenna type as well as the modulation technique.
* Lessons 2.4 and 36.1 detail security concerns.

### SATCOM
Satellite communications (SATCOM) systems relay and amplify
radio telecommunications signals via a transponder.
Communications satellites use an array of radio and microwave
frequencies.
* Communications satellites are used for television, telephone,
radio, Internet, and military applications.
* Security concerns include exploit of design flaws that can result
in injection, interception, and manipulation.

### Bluetooth
Bluetooth is a shortwave radio low power technology for
exchanging data based on the 802.15 standard. Originally
designed to replace RS-232 data cables.
* Bluetooth uses include headsets, hearing aids, wireless
speakers, PC input/out, health sensors, real-time location
systems, GPS receivers, bar coders, traffic control devices, and
game consoles.
* Range is 10-24m depending upon the version.

Subject to bluejacking and bluesnarfing:
* Bluejacking is injecting a unsolicited message.
* Bluesnarfing is unauthorized device access through a
Bluetooth discovery connection.

### Near field communication (NFC)

Near field communication (NFC) is a short range wireless
technology that requires close proximity and/or device contact.
NFC is rooted in RFID technology.
* NFC is used in commerce (e.g. contactless payment systems
such as Apple Pay), smartphone (sharing contacts, photos,
videos or files), identity and access tokens, and gaming.
* Range is less than 20 cm.
* Security concerns include eavesdropping, interception, and
theft.

### ANT
ANT is a proprietary (but open access) multi-cast wireless sensor
network technology designed for the Internet of Things (iot).
* ANT is primarily incorporated into sports and fitness sensors
(wearables), though it may additionally be used for other
purposes.
* The transceivers/receivers are embedded in equipment such as
heart rate monitors, watches, cycling power meters, cadence
meters, and distance and speed monitors monitoring a user's
performance (e.g. Fitbit).
* Range is approximately 30 meters
* Security concerns eavesdropping, interception, impersonation.

### Infrared
Infrared (IR) is an optical (infrared light) shortwave
communication technology. IR is sometimes referred to as
beaming.
* IR is used in remote control devices, portable devices such as
mobile telephones, laptops, cameras, printers, and medical
devices.
* Range is <1m and requires line of sight.
* IR has been displaced by Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

### Universal Serial bus (USB)
Wireless USB is a short—range, high—bandwidth radio bus
communication protocol.
* Wireless USB is used in game controllers, printers, scanners,
digital cameras, portable media players, hard disk drives, and
USB flash drives.
* Security concerns include packet loss and corruption.
* Range is 3-10 meters.
