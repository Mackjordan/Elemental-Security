# Mobile Device Concerns
The upside of mobile device use is communication, social
engagement, and productivity.
The downside is inadvertent or malicious circumvention of
company policies, misuse of features/functionality, and threat
exposure.
* MDM solutions can monitor activity and enforce rules.

### Device-related concerns

##### Custom firmware (ROM)
Custom firmware usually have all the extra restrictions removed, enabling users to sideload apps, tether their mobile data connection to their computer without paying extra for it, gain root access, use their device in any region etc. without any need for circumventing the protection themselves.

##### Carrier unlocking
The ability to use the device with a different carrier (e.g. ATT, Sprint, T-Mobile) than the device was initially configured for.

##### Firmware OTA updates
Firmware over-the-air (OTA) updates is a method for distributing firmware or software updates to a mobile device in contrast to having to go to a specific service center to have updates installed.

### APP-related Concerns
##### Third-party APPs
Multiple definitions for third-party APPs.
* APPs that are provided by a vendor other than the manufacturer of the device (e.g. camera APP).
* Plug-in to software (may be authorized or unauthorized).
* Applications that have not been approved or vetted by the device manufacturer.

##### Rooting (Android)
Attaining privileged control (root) over the device operating system including the ability to modify settings and run specrallzed APPs.

##### Jailbreaking (Apple)
Jailbreaking is the bypass of several types of Apple prohibitions for the end user including installing non-approved APPS via sideloading.

##### Sideloading
Transferring data between devices.
